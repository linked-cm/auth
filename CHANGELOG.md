# @\_linked/auth

## 3.0.6

### Patch Changes

- [#89](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/89) [`e2dc411`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/e2dc411ed2b9d4b45a63a3617fe8d84355e641ad) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - The server no longer dispatches auth's internal provider methods over HTTP. `upgradePasswordHash` (added in 3.0.4), `getPasswordForUser`, `getOrCreateAccount`, `loadAccountForSession` and `loadUserForSession` on the backend provider, and `createNewCredential` on `AuthCredentialProvider`, are declared with `declareInternal` from `@_linked/server-utils/utils/callable`, so `/call/@_linked/auth/...` answers 501 for them in every `rpcExposure` mode. Before, in the default `warn` mode, anyone could call them, for example to set any credential's password. Calls from backend code are unaffected. Requires `@_linked/server-utils` `^1.9.0` (was `^1.8.0`).
  
  package.json `types` now points at `lib/esm/index.d.ts`. It pointed at `index.d.ts`, which is not in the package.

## 3.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [#87](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/87) [`8a5bd85`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/8a5bd859ec5b6c9bd584523bfdaa4d84be4f23c9) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Declares its React peer; accepts React 18 or 19. The components import `react`, which is now a `peerDependencies` entry (`^18.2.0 || ^19.0.0`) so the consumer's single React copy is used.

## 3.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [#85](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/85) [`20d8200`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/20d820016086a0f19611cfe459e91f463ab49d57) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Security: stronger password hashing, and changing a password while signed in now needs the current password.
  
  - **New password hashes use bcrypt cost 10** (`PASSWORD_HASH_COST`, exported from `helpers/password`). Before, the cost was 3, which bcrypt raises to its minimum of 4. This applies to `createAccount`, `resetPassword` and `AuthCredential.createNewCredential`. A hash now takes roughly 80 ms on the server.
  - **Existing hashes upgrade on the next sign-in.** After `signinWithPassword` verifies a password whose stored hash has a lower cost, it re-hashes it at cost 10 and stores it, writing only `passwordHash`. If that write fails the sign-in still succeeds; the failure is logged and the next sign-in tries again. Nothing needs migrating. New `PasswordHelper.needsRehash(hash)`.
  - **`resetPassword` without a reset token now requires the current password**, as a new fourth argument: `resetPassword(password, confirmPassword, token, currentPassword)`. It is verified against the stored hash. Without it the call returns `{error: 'Your current password is required to change your password'}`, and with a wrong one `{error: 'Your current password is incorrect'}`. Before, a signed-in session alone could change the password.
  - An account that has **no password yet** (e.g. OAuth only) can no longer get one through `resetPassword` without a token. It returns `{error, action: 'reset_password_by_email'}`; the reset email is the way to set one.
  - The reset link path (with a token) is unchanged: no current password, single-use, expiring.
  - `CreateNewPasswordForm` (and so `EditPasswordButton`) asks for the current password when it has no `token`, and now shows the server's error instead of ignoring it.
  
  **Apps with their own change-password UI** that call `resetPassword` without a token must send the current password as the fourth argument, or the change is refused.
  
  The npm package now ships only `lib/`, `readme.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` (a `files` list). `.github/`, `.changeset/`, `docs/`, `renovate.json`, `.gitattributes` and the `tsconfig-*.json` files are no longer in the tarball.

## 3.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#83](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/83) [`11449ce`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/11449ced3a4fffe24240ed59c4349898028108d6) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Security: password reset links now expire and work only once.
  
  - A link expires **1 hour** after it is sent. Set `AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET_TTL` (whole seconds) to change that; a value that is not a positive whole number stops the server at startup, like the other `AUTH_*_TTL` settings.
  - A link works **once**. `resetPassword` removes the token as soon as it is presented with matching passwords, so a second use fails even if the first one failed later on. Mismatched passwords do not use it up.
  - Requesting a new link replaces the previous one, and changing the password while signed in ends any outstanding link.
  - Only a SHA-256 hash of the token is stored now (`forgotPasswordToken`), with its expiry in the new `AuthCredential.forgotPasswordTokenExpiresAt` property (`https://linked.cm/ont/auth/forgotPasswordTokenExpiresAt`, `xsd:dateTime`).
  
  **Links sent by earlier releases stop working.** Their tokens were stored without an expiry, so they are treated as expired; users who still have one open need to request a new link. Nothing needs migrating.
  
  `PasswordHelper.validateResetPasswordToken` now also rejects expired tokens, and the new `PasswordHelper.consumeResetPasswordToken` validates and removes a token in one step.
  
  `signinDev` (only with `DEV_AUTH=true`) no longer stores the client-supplied `email` on an account that has none. Only the email claim of the verified access token is stored; the `email` input is ignored.

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#81](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/81) [`a293246`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/a293246e0c0bec64ea55e19e5cc17392d5b44575) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Security: `signinOAuth` now only accepts providers whose token the server verifies itself, which are `google` and `apple`. Any other provider, including a missing or unknown one, returns `{error: 'Unsupported OAuth provider'}` and is logged.
  
  **Facebook sign-in via `signinOAuth` is no longer accepted** until proper Facebook token verification lands. It trusted the email the client sent, without checking it against Facebook, and signed in the account that owns that email. Apps that call `signinOAuth('facebook', …)` now get the error above.
  
  The email that is signed in now always comes from the verified Google or Apple token. An `email` field sent by the client is ignored.

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/79) [`1a11011`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/1a11011d96772df2a65659c99f7e463799b09c30) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Security: Apple identity tokens are now verified against their audience and issuer. Before, any token signed by Apple was accepted, including one Apple issued to a different app, and its email was signed in.
  
  **Action required if you use Sign in with Apple: set `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`** (the Services ID, for web sign-in) and/or **`APPLE_CLIENT_ID_IOS`** (the app's bundle ID, for native sign-in) on the server. Either may hold several comma-separated IDs. **Without one, Apple sign-in is rejected** (fail closed) and the server logs `No Apple client IDs configured, rejecting Apple sign-in`. This mirrors the existing `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID*` variables.
  
  Also:
  
  - The token must be RS256, issued by `https://appleid.apple.com`, unexpired, and carry `email_verified: true` when it has an email.
  - `signinOAuth('apple', …)` without an `identityToken` is now rejected (`No Apple identity token provided`). Before, it fell through and signed in with the email the client sent.
  - An invalid Apple token now returns `{error: 'Invalid Apple identity token'}` instead of throwing.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#70](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/70) [`30b5346`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/30b5346ecfadbe476c05d7ee877811919f59536b) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Server-set httpOnly auth cookies, a client refresh scheduler, 15-minute access tokens and session lifetime limits.
  
  **Breaking for browser clients**
  
  - The server now sets the auth cookies itself: `accessToken` (httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Path=/, until the JWT `exp`), `refreshToken` (httpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Path=`/call/@_linked/auth`, until the stored expiry) and `linkedAuthSession` (a readable `1`, no secret). `Secure` follows `req.secure` (set Express `trust proxy` behind a TLS proxy) or an https `SITE_ROOT`. JavaScript can no longer read any auth cookie, and js-cookie is gone.
  - Browsers no longer receive `refreshToken` in response bodies. Native clients that call `setAuthTokenStorageMethods` still do: the client then sends `x-linked-auth-transport: body`. Other non-browser clients (scripts, tests) can send that header too.
  - `getAccessToken()` returns the access token held in memory; right after a server-rendered page load there is none until the first refresh (the page itself was authenticated by the cookie).
  - The default access token lifetime outside development is now 15 minutes (was 10 days); development is 1 hour (was 24 hours). `AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` still overrides it.
  
  **New**
  
  - Refresh scheduler: refreshes about 60 s before the access token expires, and when the tab becomes visible or focused with a stale token. Concurrent refreshes share one request. A `Server.call` that gets a 401 refreshes once and is retried once (through `LincdServerProxy.setAuthHandler`; requires `@_linked/server-utils` ^1.8.0). A replaced refresh token presented within the 30 s grace window — a lost refresh response — gets a fresh refresh token instead of ending the session later. A session that ends while a tab is open clears all client auth state. `auth.user` keeps its identity across refreshes when unchanged. `ENFORCE_SIGNIN` tries one refresh before signing out.
  - Session limits: `AUTH_SESSION_IDLE_TTL` (default 7 days without a refresh) and `AUTH_SESSION_MAX_TTL` (default 60 days after sign-in), `0` turns either off. A new optional `auth:sessionStartedAt` is stored on `RefreshToken`; older records fall back to their session's first `createdAt`.
  - `cleanupExpiredSessions(store?, {olderThan})` deletes refresh token records revoked or expired more than 30 days ago (`AUTH_SESSION_CLEANUP_AFTER`). The backend provider runs it in the background at most once a day per process; `AUTH_SESSION_CLEANUP=false` turns that off.
  - `validateToken(refreshToken?, {forceRefresh})`; signing out and a failed refresh clear the cookies.
  - Cookie overrides: `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE`, `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE`, `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE_PATH`.
  
  **Migrating an app**
  
  - Remove any code that reads or writes the `accessToken`/`refreshToken` cookies from JavaScript; keep the server reading `request.cookies.accessToken` or, better, `request.linkedAuth`.
  - Behind a TLS-terminating proxy, set `app.set('trust proxy', …)`.
  - If the frontend is served from another site than the API, set `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=none`.
  - Users stay signed in: a refresh cookie written by the previous client on `/` is still accepted once and replaced by the scoped one.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#68](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/68) [`5c4c2de`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/5c4c2de781316b190b114384b884dd722bd6f1da) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - - A missing `JWT_SECRET` / `SESSION_SECRET` outside development/test now throws a `FatalConfigError`
    (`fatal: true`). @_linked/server releases that honour `fatal` abort startup on it instead of
    logging the failed provider hook and serving with broken auth.
  - Token responses (every sign-in, `validateToken`, `updateSessionData`) now carry
    `refreshTokenExpiresIn` (seconds) and `refreshTokenExpiresAt` (ISO) for the refresh token they
    return. The client sizes the refresh cookie from them, so it no longer outlives the server's
    record when `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL` is shorter than the client default; the access cookie keeps
    following the JWT `exp`. Without these fields (older servers) the client falls back to its
    defaults, and leaves an unchanged echoed refresh token alone instead of extending it.
    New export `storeAuthTokens` in `utils/token`.
  - A non-JWT value presented as an access token (typically the opaque refresh token) is no longer
    logged; other rejected tokens (bad signature, wrong audience or kind) are logged once per token.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#66](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/66) [`58a8b34`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/58a8b34752913d47e4b4d7ad0dda5c9b072d0e92) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Auth's ontology moves from `http://lincd.org/ont/auth/` to `https://linked.cm/ont/auth/`, the first-party scheme every public package uses (`https://linked.cm/ont/{publicSlug}/`, next to its shapes at `https://linked.cm/shape/auth/`).
  
  **Breaking — stored auth data must be migrated.** Every auth class and property changed IRI. Credentials, refresh token records and the synced shape descriptions written by 1.x are invisible to this release until they are rewritten: sign-in answers "No password found for this email". Nothing is deleted. Run the migration once per dataset that auth shapes are stored in, right after deploying:
  
  ```ts
  import { migrateAuthNamespace } from '@_linked/auth/utils/migrateNamespace';
  await migrateAuthNamespace(store, { dryRun: true }); // counts only
  await migrateAuthNamespace(store); // { before: N, after: 0, dryRun: false }
  ```
  
  - `migrateAuthNamespace(dataset, {dryRun?})` rewrites every IRI under the legacy namespace (subject, predicate and object, default graph and every named graph) in one SPARQL UPDATE request. Literals are untouched. It is idempotent. `dataset` is any store with `rawQuery` (e.g. `FusekiStore`), not a dataset router.
  - `hasLegacyAuthData(dataset)` is a cheap boot-time check for records the migration has not reached; `countLegacyAuthTriples(dataset)` counts everything left.
  - The ontology terms (`auth.AuthCredential`, `auth.passwordHash`, …) keep their names; only their IRIs change. Code that hard-codes `http://lincd.org/ont/auth/` in SPARQL must be updated.
  - `RefreshToken`: `tokenHash`, `sessionId`, `account`, `createdAt` and `expiresAt` are now required, so creating a record without them is refused instead of storing a token that can never match or expire. The session store reads and writes the records through the typed query DSL without casts.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/64) [`8966cf5`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/8966cf5a29e86aaffd17861662b4e0e28bd57e9b) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Token security: refresh tokens can no longer be used as access tokens, and refresh now actually works.
  
  - **Access tokens are typed.** They carry `typ: 'access'`, `aud` (SITE_ROOT), `sid` (session) and `jti`. Every access check — the request middleware, `verifyToken`, `validateToken` — accepts only access tokens for the right audience. Previously a refresh token (a 60-day JWT) was accepted as a login. Access tokens issued by earlier releases keep working until they expire (they carry `aud`); earlier refresh tokens (no `aud`) are refused.
  - **New `verifyAccessToken(token, {audience?})`** in `@_linked/auth/utils/jwt`. Apps that verify tokens themselves should use it instead of `jwt.verify`.
  - **Refresh tokens are stored, hashed and rotated.** A refresh token is now an opaque random value; only its SHA-256 hash is stored, as a `RefreshToken` shape (new properties: `tokenHash`, `sessionId`, `createdAt`, `lastUsedAt`, `expiresAt`, `revokedAt`, `replacedBy`; the raw-token `token` property is gone). `validateToken` exchanges it for new tokens and rotates it; presenting a replaced token again revokes the whole session (a 30-second grace covers concurrent tabs). Sign-out revokes the session, a password reset revokes every session of the account, and removing an account deletes its records. The request middleware no longer refreshes.
  - **Behaviour change — refresh tokens issued by earlier releases are invalid** (they were never stored, so they cannot be checked). Users sign in again when their current access token expires, which is also what happened before: refresh never succeeded.
  - **Behaviour change — the server refuses to start without `JWT_SECRET` and `SESSION_SECRET`** unless `NODE_ENV` is `development` or `test` (an unset NODE_ENV and `staging` count as production). Generate them with `openssl rand -base64 48`. Development keeps the old fallbacks and warns.
  - Lifetimes are configurable with `AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` / `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL` (seconds); defaults are unchanged.
  - The token verification cache now drops an entry at the token's own expiry (it served expired tokens before) and is bounded.
  - Client: cookies get the right lifetime (seconds were passed to js-cookie as days); the access cookie expires with the token; `validateToken` refreshes with the refresh token alone once the access token is gone; `signout` sends the refresh token so the server can revoke the session.
  - Removed `RefreshToken.removeRefreshToken` and `RefreshToken.getRefreshTokenForAccount` (they matched on a raw token that was never stored); use `revokeSession`, `revokeAllSessionsForAccount` and `deleteAllSessionsForAccount` from `@_linked/auth/utils/sessions`.
  - `removeAccount` deletes the credential, account and person by reference (it passed whole query results to `delete`, which rejected them).

## 1.6.5

### Patch Changes

- [#58](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/58) [`514ea33`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/514ea330ec55865081c90137440ba2070a0badb9) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - Drop the unused `chalk` dependency. Nothing in the package imported it.

## 1.6.4

### Patch Changes

- [#57](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/57) [`c4f4a7e`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/c4f4a7e5d5c38c8ada78de013cfade47d65fa31c) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - Upgrade bcrypt to 6. It ships prebuilt N-API binaries for linux (glibc and musl, x64/arm64/arm), macOS and Windows inside the package, so installing no longer downloads a binary from GitHub or falls back to a node-gyp compile. Requires Node 18 or newer. Existing password hashes keep verifying — a test pins hashes produced by bcrypt 5 against the built helper.

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- [#53](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/53) [`c752b50`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/c752b5062db4eaa721a021a8dcc7fd37ca27c6c8) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Add `shapes/index`, a side-effect-only module that registers every shape this package defines and nothing else (no components, no CSS), so `import '@_linked/auth/shapes/index'` loads the shapes in plain node as well as in a bundle. The package entry now imports it instead of listing shapes one by one.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/51) [`fc82382`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/fc823821e6a8b324ce6f36d8c15862e74d3b4e2c) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Reference UserAccount and Person by class, so loading an auth shape registers them.

  The shapes named them by `[package, name]`, which does not register anything. They
  were registered only because `emitDecoratorMetadata` happened to keep the getter
  return-type import alive in the tsc build; a consumer compiling the source with
  esbuild (a localized checkout under Vite) emits no metadata, loses the import, and
  queries traversing `account` or `credentialOf` throw `Shape class not found`.

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#43](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/43) [`0d4c713`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/0d4c713d2213a69a6a4cb367cce96c8b6035ae7f) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Sourcemaps now embed their TypeScript source, so consumers no longer see 'points to missing source files' warnings.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#40](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/40) [`0581885`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/0581885d4ff3841ac6b0dc709d7d605c59f479a7) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Drop the `foaf` dependency — the last legacy `lincd` package reachable from this tree.

  `foaf` was used for types only: no emitted `.js` in `lib/` ever imported it, so the legacy
  `lincd` framework copy it pulls in (`lincd`, `lincd-jsonld`, `lincd-rdfs`,
  `lincd-design-elems`) was never loaded at runtime — it only sat in the installed tree.

  - `src/types/auth.ts` and `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`: the import (and, in `useAuth`, the
    `type Person` alias) were entirely unused. Removed.
  - `src/backend.ts`: `type Person = FoafPerson | SchemaPerson` widened to `Shape`.
  - `src/utils/auth.ts`: `Auth.userType` widened from
    `typeof SchemaPerson | typeof FoafPerson` to `typeof Shape`, and the two
    `QResult<SchemaPerson | FoafPerson>` callback positions to `QResult<Shape>`.

  All three are widenings, so existing callers keep compiling; `AuthProviderProps.userType`
  already used `typeof Shape`, so this makes the two sides agree.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/38) [`65e425c`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/65e425cae6c6ad96056ea12842444c73d33c8c23) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Require `@_linked/core@^2.22.8` (was `^2.0.1`), and pin it in the lockfile.

  The declared range was wide enough that the resolved core depended on whatever the
  consumer — or this repo's own CI, via `package-lock.json` — happened to install. Core
  decides how a shape's IRI is minted, so a stale core made this package emit legacy
  `data.lincd.org` IRIs instead of the arch-02 `linked.cm` scheme. Which IRIs a published
  package produces should not be a function of the installer's dependency tree.

  Minor rather than patch: this raises the minimum core a consumer must resolve, so it
  changes what gets installed rather than only what this package does internally.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#36](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/36) [`8a8442b`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/8a8442b282babddcebc21bf6c836f715aa1e8e08) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - The six account screens are built on `@_linked/primitives`, and the last `lincd-*`
  dependencies are gone.

  `Button` and `Modal` came from `lincd-mui-base` and `TextField` from `lincd-input`. Those
  are now `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog` and `ConfirmDialog` from `@_linked/primitives`, adapted
  at each call site rather than by widening the shared components: `variant="outlined"` maps
  to `outline`, `color` carries over unchanged, `startIcon` becomes a child (Button's root is
  already a flex row with a gap), `fullWidth` becomes one `width: 100%` in each component's
  own CSS module, `helperText` becomes a sibling paragraph beside the field, and
  `endAdornment` becomes a positioned control inside a relative wrapper.

  Two changes are behavioural rather than cosmetic, both improvements:

  - **Every modal in this package works again.** `lincd-mui-base`'s `Modal` wraps
    `@mui/base`'s `FocusTrap`, which throws `rootRef.current.contains is not a function`
    under React 19 — opening any of them unmounted the whole React tree. The Radix-backed
    `Dialog` also brings a focus trap, Escape handling, `aria-modal`, focus restoration and a
    close affordance.
  - **`RemoveAccountButton` now asks with a `ConfirmDialog` in `tone="danger"`** instead of a
    hand-built body inside a generic modal. That makes it an `alertdialog`, so a click on the
    backdrop no longer dismisses a destructive confirmation.

  The screens also pick up `@_linked/css` tokens for the first time. Their colours previously
  resolved through `--ld-app-color-*` and `--ld-ref-palette-*`, which are defined nowhere, so
  they rendered essentially unstyled; the local overrides that fought those undefined tokens
  have been removed rather than given more specificity.

  Also: the full-viewport centring that lived on `CreateNewPasswordForm`'s own root moved to
  `ForgotPasswordCallback`, the page that wants it. On the root it forced a `100vh` box inside
  the dialog that `EditPasswordButton` renders the same form into.

## 1.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [#33](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/33) [`21f9c4e`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/21f9c4eecb60bec4d07a462e4fb3362fcc82fed1) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - The ontology no longer registers by importing itself.

  It carried `import * as _this from './<prefix>.js'` and passed that namespace to
  `linkedOntology()`. Under `tsc` the self-reference survives; under a bundler it does
  not — Rollup treats it as a circular import and elides it, so the binding is
  `undefined` and a consuming app dies at boot with `_this is not defined`.

  Registration now lives in a `<prefix>.register.ts` sibling, imported from the package
  entry. Nothing changes for consumers: importing this package still registers the
  ontology.

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/30) [`8e108c2`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/8e108c253e85878d88474656b37711034c1ac11b) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Point the changelog generator at this repo's real org.

  `.changeset/config.json` still named `linked-cm/auth` as the GitHub repo, but
  this package lives in `linked-fw/auth`. Every commit, PR and author link that
  `@changesets/changelog-github` wrote into `CHANGELOG.md` therefore pointed at a
  repository that does not exist. Renaming the org makes the generated links
  resolve.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/28) [`0cf087f`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/0cf087f6502a1efaf422905f85afb3d210b79304) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Compile the whole `src` folder, and let a bare import resolve under Node10.

  The build only emitted what an entry transitively reached, so any module
  nothing imported was never built — and never type-checked, so it rotted
  quietly. `include` now covers `src/**/*` with tests excluded explicitly.

  `typesVersions` maps every specifier through `lib/esm/*`, so a `types` value
  that already carried that prefix had it applied twice and no consumer on
  classic Node10 resolution could `import` the package by its bare name.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#25](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/pull/25) [`11e67f0`](https://github.com/linked-fw/auth/commit/11e67f0cb8b20a7386b936efaeefe2db0c3f1fe3) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Declare npm as the package manager for this repo, convert the build scripts off `yarn`, and mark `package-lock.json` as a generated file.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#19](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/19) [`4b1689e`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/4b1689e1a1095063d01c5f0b171f751c2f7a2082) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Rename `IdentityToken.subject` to `IdentityToken.sub`.

  `subject` is a field of the query builder, so `IdentityToken.select(t => [t.subject])` and
  `.where(t => t.subject.equals(...))` resolved to that field instead of the property and failed.
  This broke `getTokenByEmailOrSubject`, `getTokenByAccount` and `hasToken`.

  The RDF predicate is unchanged (`auth:subject`), so stored tokens need no migration. Update
  any code that reads `token.subject` from query results or passes `subject` to
  `IdentityToken.create`/`update` to use `sub`.

## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- [#12](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/12) [`ef1c23b`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/ef1c23b12e7b49481d6f5124e2404279028c63fa) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Dev signin now builds the session user as plain identity data (`{ id }`, a QResult) instead of a live `Shape` instance. A live Shape crossed the SSR/JWT serialization boundary and reached the client as an unusable `{__s, u}` reference (undefined `.id`), breaking auth-dependent UI (e.g. the workspace name showing `?`). Also removes the interim `reviveShapeRef` workaround.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/9) [`2fa7118`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/2fa7118a64e3689f901c0cc8186bbe6010690d90) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Remove the `development` export condition (pointed at `src`, which isn't shipped to npm). Monorepo dev resolves workspace source via the cli Vite plugin; standalone resolves `import → lib`. No consumer-visible change.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/7) [`406f7ef`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/406f7ef365bbd5069a3e5cb68724169032aecebd) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - loadData: ESM-only JSON import — drop the dead CJS branch, add the `{ with: { type: 'json' } }` import attribute.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/5) [`ed9add7`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/ed9add71319bc306be42bae527c5fb2faeef37fc) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - **ESM-only.** Dropped the CommonJS build; ships ES modules only (`type: module`, no `require` export condition). Fixed the root `types` field. CJS projects on Node 22+ can `require()` it (sync ESM) or use dynamic `import()`.

### Patch Changes

- [#5](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/5) [`0f1f502`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/0f1f5028e1a36415d98616b7ef9d40f90ad30263) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - Migrated all `lincd-sioc` references to `@_linked/sioc` (the new package
  name; sioc was extracted from `lincd.org/modules/` to its own workspace

  - git repo — see the `@_linked/sioc@1.1.0` release notes for the
    package-side story).

  Internal changes (no consumer-facing API change):

  - 10 source files updated: `UserAccount` imports across `backend.ts`,
    `hooks/useAuth.tsx`, `shapes/{AuthCredential, Authentication, IdentityToken,
Password, RefreshToken}.ts`, `types/auth.ts`, `utils/auth.ts`.
  - 3 shape-registration strings updated: `['lincd-sioc', 'UserAccount']` →
    `['@_linked/sioc', 'UserAccount']` in `shapes/{IdentityToken, Password,
RefreshToken}.ts`. The string is the package name stored on the shape
    for dispatch; the new value matches what `linkedPackage('@_linked/sioc')`
    registers.
  - `package.json`: dropped `lincd-sioc: ~1.0`, added `@_linked/sioc: workspace:*`
    (or pin to the published `@_linked/sioc@^1.1` if consuming as a
    published package).

  Consumers should update their own `lincd-sioc` deps to `@_linked/sioc`
  when they upgrade `@_linked/auth` to this version, to avoid having
  both packages installed side-by-side.

  Context: see create-now plan-011 report (docs/reports/009-legacy-lincd-eradication.md).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/pull/2) [`7c8d701`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/7c8d701c8da685a54ebf88ee5dab1a8ee0537576) Thanks [@flyon](https://github.com/flyon)! - - `feat(webid)`: UUID v5 derivation with public namespace; restore `telephoneToWebID` with dedicated phone namespace
  - `fix(backend)`: use `UserAccount.email` lookup instead of `webIDToEmail(user.id)`
  - `feat(signin-dev)`: `AuthBackendProvider.signinDev` + `useAuth.signinDev` hook
  - `fix(signin-dev)`: tolerate boolean `true` in `DEV_AUTH` env var; select a real decorated property when looking up Person
  - `fix(build)`: switch to explicit per-step build pipeline so silent build failures no longer ship empty tarballs

## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- [`9c5b6aa`](https://github.com/linked-cm/auth/commit/9c5b6aac3c5b497077bdbf687132e489cfd3ada3) - Initial release under the new publishing setup.
