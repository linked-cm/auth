/**
 * A sign-in nonce that has been used. Nonces are issued without storing anything (they are
 * signed, see `utils/oauthNonce.ts`); a record is only written when a nonce is redeemed with a
 * valid provider token, so the same nonce, and with it the same identity token, can never sign
 * in twice. A record is useless once its nonce has expired and is deleted after that.
 *
 * This module stays free of server-only imports (it is part of the client bundle).
